# Password Generator Starter Code

This project allows the user to generate a password to meet different criteria.

They can select password lengths between 8 and 128 characters, and choose whether it includes the following characters:

- uppercase
- lowercase
- numeric
- special

This password generator is designed to avoid introducing patterns into each password.

Given the character type inputs, it will ensure each password contains at least one of each type, but a random amount more.

Password is built by inserting each new character into a random index.
